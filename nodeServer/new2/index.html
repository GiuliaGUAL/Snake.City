			Snake.City is an urban game that can be played anywhere and with anybody.

			To play to Snake.City, two players need to place their thumbs on each side of a mobile phone, a third person needs do the same, and so on, until they form a human chain making a SNAKE!

			Try to create the longest and most enduring snake on Earth.

			Be careful! Whenever a person remove a thumb, the snake is broken and the time is up!
