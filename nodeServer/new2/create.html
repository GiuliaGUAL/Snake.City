			<h2>What is this game?</h2>
			<div class="gameText"> 
				Snake.City is an urban game that can be played anywhere and with anybody.
				To play to Snake.City, two players need to place their thumbs on each side of a mobile phone, a third person needs do the same, and so on, until they form a human chain making a SNAKE!
				Try to create the longest and most enduring snake on Earth.
			</div>

			<h2>Make your own game</h2>
			<div class="gameText"> 
				We have created a handy PDF to allow you to create your own Snake.City GAME. 
				We've decided to call this a PLAY Blueprint, because it is a blueprint for creating playful experiences.
				In this PLAY blueprint we will use different techniques, tools and programming languages.
				This includes hosting your own server in Node JS, learning about Websockets and writing code in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

			<h2>COVID and snakes</h2>
			<div class="gameText"> 
				We set out to make a fun urban game that involved both social and physical play.
				When we started this project, we were living in a world without Covid.It depends where you live and the local rules, but it might not be a good idea to rush out and play closely with strangers in these worrying times.
				That said, there are three big reasons you might be interested in Snake.City. First, the three of us wanted to learn new tech that would make multi-player physical games possible. We want to share that tech with you. Secondly, we are worried that we will forget how to play nicely with each other. If you have house mates or friends within your bubble, Snake.City might help you reconnect. 
				Lastly, we think Snake.City is fun. You might too.
