		We set out to make a fun urban game that involved both social and physical play.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		
		When we started this project, we were living in a world without Covid.

		<br>
		<br>

		It depends where you live and the local rules, but it might not be a good idea to rush out and play closely with strangers in these worrying times.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		That said, there are three big reasons you might be interested in Snake.City.
		<br>
		<br>
		First, the three of us wanted to learn new tech that would make multi-player physical games possible. We want to share that tech with you.
		<br>
		<br>
		Secondly, we are worried that we will forget how to play nicely with each other. If you have house mates or friends within your bubble, Snake.City might help you reconnect.
		<br>
		<br>
		Lastly, we think Snake.City is fun. You might too.
		<br>

		Thank you from  Tomo, Giulia and Gavin
